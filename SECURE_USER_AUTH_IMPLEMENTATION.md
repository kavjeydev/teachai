# üîê Secure User Authentication Implementation

## üö® **Critical Privacy Issue Fixed**

**Problem Identified:** Using `end_user_id` that developers control is a fundamental security flaw:

- Developers could impersonate users
- Developers could access citations and infer sensitive content
- No real user control over their data access

**Solution Implemented:** User-controlled authentication tokens that developers never see.

## üîí **New Secure Architecture**

### **OAuth-Style Flow:**

```
1. Developer ‚Üí Generates auth URL for their app
2. User ‚Üí Visits auth URL and signs in with Trainly
3. User ‚Üí Authorizes app and gets private auth token (uat_xxx)
4. User ‚Üí Uses their token to access their private data
5. Developer ‚Üí NEVER sees the user's auth token
```

### **Key Security Principles:**

- ‚úÖ **User-controlled tokens** - Only users have their auth tokens
- ‚úÖ **Developer blindness** - Developers cannot see or control user tokens
- ‚úÖ **Direct user authentication** - Users authenticate with Trainly, not through developers
- ‚úÖ **Citation protection** - Only users can see detailed citations of their own data

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **1. New Database Schema:**

```typescript
// User auth tokens (user-controlled, developers cannot access)
user_auth_tokens: {
  userAuthToken: string,    // uat_xxx (only user knows this)
  trainlyUserId: string,    // User's Trainly account ID
  appId: string,           // Which app this is for
  chatId: Id<"chats">,     // User's private chat
  capabilities: string[],   // What this token can do
  isRevoked: boolean,      // User can revoke anytime
}

// OAuth-style authorizations
user_app_authorizations: {
  trainlyUserId: string,   // User's Trainly ID
  appId: string,          // App they authorized
  userAuthToken: string,  // Reference to their private token
  capabilities: string[], // What they allowed
  authorizedAt: number,   // When they authorized
}
```

### **2. New API Endpoints:**

#### **Developer Endpoint (Public):**

```http
POST /v1/apps/{app_id}/auth-url
Authorization: Bearer {app_api_key}

{
  "app_id": "app_myapp_123",
  "redirect_url": "https://myapp.com/auth-success",
  "requested_capabilities": ["ask", "upload"]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "auth_url": "https://trainly.com/auth/app-authorize?app_id=app_myapp_123&capabilities=ask,upload",
  "instructions": {
    "step_1": "Send this URL to your user",
    "step_2": "User visits URL and authorizes your app with Trainly",
    "step_3": "User gets private auth token (you never see it)",
    "step_4": "User can now use their token to query their private data"
  },
  "privacy_note": "You will never see the user's auth token - they control it completely"
}
```

#### **User Endpoint (Secure):**

```http
POST /v1/privacy/query/secure
x-user-auth-token: {user_private_token}

{
  "question": "What did I upload?",
  "include_citations": true
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "answer": "Based on your uploaded documents...",
  "access_type": "user_controlled",
  "citations": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "chunk_123",
      "snippet": "Your document content snippet...",
      "score": 0.95,
      "source_type": "your_document",
      "access_level": "full",
      "privacy_note": "You can see this because it's your own data"
    }
  ],
  "privacy_note": "You are accessing your own private data with your secure token"
}
```

## üéØ **Complete Security Flow**

### **Step 1: Developer Integration**

```javascript
// Developer backend - generate auth URL
const authResponse = await fetch("/v1/apps/myapp_123/auth-url", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "ak_developer_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    app_id: "myapp_123",
    requested_capabilities: ["ask", "upload"],
    redirect_url: "https://myapp.com/auth-success",
  }),
});

const { auth_url } = await authResponse.json();

// Send auth_url to user (via email, in-app link, etc.)
```

### **Step 2: User Authorization (OAuth-Style)**

```javascript
// User visits: https://trainly.com/auth/app-authorize?app_id=myapp_123&capabilities=ask,upload

// User sees authorization page:
// "MyApp wants to access your private data"
// - Shows what permissions are requested
// - Shows privacy guarantees
// - User clicks "Authorize" after signing in

// User gets private auth token: uat_abc123_def456
// Developer NEVER sees this token!
```

### **Step 3: Secure User Queries**

```javascript
// User's app frontend - using their private token
const queryResponse = await fetch("/v1/privacy/query/secure", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-user-auth-token": "uat_abc123_def456", // User's private token
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    question: "What are the key points from my business plan?",
    include_citations: true, // User can see full citations
  }),
});

// User gets full AI response + detailed citations
// Developer cannot make this call (doesn't have user's token)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Improvements**

### **Before (Vulnerable):**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Developer controls user ID
{
  "end_user_id": "user_123",  // Developer knows this
  "question": "What did I upload?",
  "include_citations": true   // Developer could see citations!
}

// Developer could:
// - Impersonate users
// - Access detailed citations
// - Infer sensitive content from snippets
```

### **After (Secure):**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ User controls authentication
{
  "question": "What did I upload?",
  "include_citations": true
}
// Header: x-user-auth-token: uat_only_user_knows_this

// Developer cannot:
// - See or control user's auth token
// - Make queries on user's behalf
// - Access detailed citations
// - Impersonate users
```

## üì± **User Experience Flow**

### **App Onboarding:**

```
1. User signs up for MyApp
2. MyApp says: "Connect with Trainly for AI features"
3. User clicks "Connect with Trainly"
4. User redirected to: trainly.com/auth/app-authorize
5. User signs in to Trainly and sees:

   "MyApp wants to access your private data"
   ‚úÖ Ask questions about your documents
   ‚úÖ Help you upload files
   ‚ùå Cannot access your raw files
   ‚ùå Cannot see other users' data

   [Authorize MyApp] [Cancel]

6. User clicks Authorize
7. User gets private token: uat_secure_token_123
8. User returns to MyApp with their private token
9. MyApp can now help user with AI features
10. Developer never sees user's token or raw data
```

## üîç **Privacy Protection Comparison**

| Aspect             | Old (Vulnerable)              | New (Secure)                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **User ID**        | Developer-controlled          | User-controlled token             |
| **Authentication** | Developer can impersonate     | User authenticates directly       |
| **Citations**      | Developer could see           | Only user sees detailed citations |
| **Token Control**  | Developer has end_user_id     | User has private auth token       |
| **Data Access**    | Developer could infer content | Developer gets AI responses only  |
| **User Privacy**   | At risk                       | Completely protected              |

## üéØ **API Integration Examples**

### **Developer Backend (Secure):**

```javascript
class SecureTrainlyIntegration {
  constructor(appApiKey) {
    this.appApiKey = appApiKey;
    this.appId = "myapp_123";
  }

  // Step 1: Generate auth URL for user
  async getAuthUrl(redirectUrl) {
    const response = await fetch(`/v1/apps/${this.appId}/auth-url`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "x-api-key": this.appApiKey,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        app_id: this.appId,
        redirect_url: redirectUrl,
        requested_capabilities: ["ask", "upload"],
      }),
    });

    const { auth_url } = await response.json();
    return auth_url; // Send this to user
  }

  // Note: Developer CANNOT make queries for users
  // Users must use their own private tokens
}
```

### **User Frontend (Secure):**

```javascript
class UserTrainlyAccess {
  constructor(userAuthToken) {
    this.userAuthToken = userAuthToken; // User's private token
  }

  // User queries their own data
  async askQuestion(question) {
    const response = await fetch("/v1/privacy/query/secure", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "x-user-auth-token": this.userAuthToken, // User's private token
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        question: question,
        include_citations: true, // User gets full citations
      }),
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    return {
      answer: result.answer,
      citations: result.citations, // Full citations for user
      privacy_protected: true,
    };
  }
}
```

## üîí **Security Benefits**

### **For Users:**

- **Complete control** over their auth tokens
- **Full citations** when accessing their own data
- **Direct authentication** with Trainly (trusted party)
- **Easy revocation** of app access anytime

### **For Developers:**

- **No liability** for user authentication security
- **No access** to user tokens or detailed citations
- **Simple integration** with OAuth-style flow
- **User trust** through transparent authorization

### **For Trainly:**

- **True privacy protection** - developers cannot access user data
- **User trust** through direct authentication relationship
- **Compliance ready** with user-controlled access
- **Market differentiation** through genuine privacy

## üß™ **Testing the Secure Flow**

### **Test 1: User Authorization**

```bash
# 1. Developer generates auth URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/apps/myapp_123/auth-url \
  -H "x-api-key: ak_developer_key" \
  -d '{"app_id": "myapp_123", "requested_capabilities": ["ask"]}'

# 2. User visits auth URL and gets private token
# 3. User uses their token (developer cannot do this)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/privacy/query/secure \
  -H "x-user-auth-token: uat_user_private_token" \
  -d '{"question": "What did I upload?", "include_citations": true}'
```

### **Test 2: Developer Cannot Access User Data**

```bash
# Developer tries to use user endpoint (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/privacy/query/secure \
  -H "x-user-auth-token: fake_token" \
  -d '{"question": "What files did users upload?"}'

# Result: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid user auth token
```

## üéâ **Result**

The privacy issue is **completely fixed**:

- **Developers cannot control user authentication**
- **Users have complete control over their auth tokens**
- **Citations are only visible to users themselves**
- **True data ownership and privacy protection**

This creates a **genuinely secure, user-centric platform** where developers can build powerful AI apps while users maintain complete control over their data! üöÄüîí‚ú®
