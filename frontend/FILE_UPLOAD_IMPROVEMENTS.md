# File Upload Queue System - Implementation Complete! 🚀

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Folder Upload Support**
- Users can now upload entire folders by clicking the new folder icon
- Maintains folder structure and relative paths
- Automatically detects folder uploads vs individual files

### 2. **Background Processing Queue**
- Files are processed in the background without blocking the UI
- Users can continue chatting while files are being processed
- Sequential processing prevents server overload

### 3. **Real-time Progress Monitoring**
- Live progress tracking for each file
- Queue overview with completion statistics
- Individual file status (pending, processing, completed, failed)

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Cancel queues in progress
- Error handling with detailed messages
- Visual indicators for different file states
- Folder vs file upload distinction

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (Convex)
```typescript
// File upload queue tracking
file_upload_queue: {
  userId, chatId, queueId, fileName, fileSize, fileType,
  filePath, status, progress, error, fileId,
  extractedTextLength, nodesCreated, timestamps
}

// Queue management
upload_queues: {
  queueId, userId, chatId, name, totalFiles,
  completedFiles, failedFiles, status, isFolder, timestamps
}
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **useFileQueue Hook** (`/hooks/use-file-queue.ts`)
- Manages file upload queues and background processing
- Handles file processing pipeline (extract → embed → store)
- Provides real-time status updates

#### 2. **FileQueueMonitor Component** (`/components/file-queue-monitor.tsx`)
- Visual queue progress monitoring
- Individual file status tracking
- Queue management (cancel, view details)

#### 3. **Enhanced Chat Dashboard**
- Dual upload buttons (files + folders)
- Integrated queue monitoring
- Non-blocking file processing

### Processing Pipeline
```
User Upload → Queue Creation → Background Processing → Context Addition
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Files/Folder → Database Entry → Text Extraction → Knowledge Graph
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Single File Upload
- Click paperclip icon
- Select one or multiple files
- Files are queued and processed in background
- Continue chatting immediately

### Folder Upload
- Click folder icon
- Select entire folder
